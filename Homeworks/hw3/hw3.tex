In 1969, the popular magazine \textit{Psychology Today }published
a 101-question survey on affairs. Professor Ray Fair (1978) extracted
a sample of 601 observations on men and women who are currently married
for the first time and analyzed their responses to a question about
extramarital affairs. He used the tobit model as his estimation framework
for this study. The dependent variable is a count of the number of
affairs which suggests that a standard Poisson model may be a better
choice. \ Download the data set hw3.mat, and estimate the parameters
by the methods of nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood using
different algorithms.

Data description:

$y$ - count data: number of affairs in the past year

$\mathbf{x}$ - constant term=1, age, number of years married, religiousness
(scale $1-5$), occupation (scale $1-7$), self-rating of marriage
(scale $1-5$)

\bigskip{}

The data generating assumptions for the Poisson model, where $j$=
number of affairs, are:\bigskip{}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Pr\left[y_{i}=j\right] & = & \frac{e^{-\lambda_{i}}\lambda_{i}^{j}}{j!}\\
\log\lambda_{i} & = & \mathbf{x}_{i}^{\prime}\mathbf{\beta}\\
E\left(y_{i}\left\vert x_{i}\right.\right) & = & e^{\mathbf{x}_{i}\prime\mathbf{\beta}}
\end{eqnarray*}
for some $\mathbf{\beta}=\left(\beta_{0},\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\beta_{3},\beta_{4},\beta_{5}\right)^{\prime}.$

\bigskip{}

The log-likelihood function is:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\ln L & = & \sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}\ln f\left(y_{i}\left\vert x_{i}\right.,\beta\right)\\
 & = & \sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}\ln\frac{e^{-\lambda_{i}}\lambda_{i}^{j}}{j!}\\
 & = & \sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}\left[-\lambda_{i}+y_{i}\ln\lambda_{i}-\ln j!\right]\\
 & = & \sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}\left[-e^{\mathbf{x}_{i}\prime\mathbf{\beta}}+y_{i}x_{i}^{\prime}\beta-\ln y_{i}!\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

The residual sum of squares is:
\[
S\left(\beta\right)=\sum\limits _{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-e^{\beta^{\prime}x_{i}}\right)^{2}
\]
